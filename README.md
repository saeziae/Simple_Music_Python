# Simple_Music_Python
Play music from notes

---

You have to install `pyaudio` (`pip install pyaudio`, you'll need a C compiler)


`music.txt` format:
> tone **\\t** beats  
> tone **\\t** beats  
> tone **\\t** beats  
> tone **\\t** beats  
> tone **\\t** beats  
> ...

For example (do NOT copy this, it is all spaces, you'll need to use TAB instead)
```
C4  0.5
D4  0.5
E4  1
D4  0.75
C4  0.25
C4  1
```
significar:
```
         4 
1 = C   --- 
         4 
|              |
| 1 2 3 2. 1 1 |
| ---   ---=   |
```
